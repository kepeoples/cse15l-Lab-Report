# **Lab Report 1**

Three basic filesystem commands—cd, ls, and cat—were the focus of today's lab.  
In a Unix-based operating system, these commands are crucial for browsing and working with directories and files.  
I'll present examples of using these commands both without arguments and with paths to directories or files in this report.  

 1) **The 'cd' Command**:
```$ cd```  
Working Directory: /home/username

Output: No output  

```$ cd```    
```$ cd```    

 3) **The 'ls' Command**:  
```$ ls```  
```$ ls```  
```$ ls```

  
 5) **The 'cat' Command**:  
```$ cat```  
```$ cat```  
```$ cat```

**Conclusion**  
In this lab report, we looked at several instances for the fundamental filesystem operations cd, ls, and cat.  
We covered the anticipated results and potential mistakes associated with each use scenario, as well as how to use these commands with directory paths, file paths, and no parameters.  
For effective file and directory navigation and manipulation in a Unix-based operating system, understanding these commands is crucial.
